# Laravel React w/ Redux, Typescript and JEST Boilerplate

It is a Laravel boilerplate with React, Redux, Typescript and JEST configured and ready to use. I thought it would be nice of me to publish it, since I couldn't find such a stack on relatively fresh packages versions. Hopefully someone will use it and would save a couple of working hours on configuring a new package.

## About
